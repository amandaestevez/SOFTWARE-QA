# SLDC - TESTING & QA


_This document outlines the testing & QA roles in the software development lifecycle. It is valid whether one person or an entire team performs testing. To exemplify, we will follow the story of the development of a fictional mobile banking app called ZippyBank._

## What is the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)?
SDLC is a process used to create software that meets the stakeholders' requirements cost-efficiently, avoiding rework and waste of resources.

Examples of the different SLDC models include:

|SEQUENTIAL MODELS | ITERATIVE MODELS | INCREMENTAL MODELS |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Waterfall | Spiral model | United Process |
| V-model | Prototyping | Feature-Driven Development (FDD) |

## Why is the SDLC Choice Relevant to Testing?

According to the [ISTQB Certified Tester - Foundation Level Syllabus - v4.0](https://istqb-main-web-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus-v4.0.pdf), **testing must be adapted to the chosen SDLC process to succeed**. The SDLC method deeply impacts the scope and timing of testing activities.

The six core phases we shall see below form the foundation of various SDLC models, which arrange them differently to fit project needs.

## Testing & The Software Development Lifecycle

The below RUP(Rational Unified Process) diagram created by IBM shows that Testing & QA is present throughout the entire SDLC:

## Methodology

This document will employ a case-study methodology to showcase Testing & QA integration throughout the SDLC using ZippyBank, a fictional mobile banking app. We'll explore the six SDLC phases with ZippyBank examples, like identifying risks in planning and using checklists for deployment validation. This will illustrate how a well-integrated testing strategy ensures software quality from conception to maintenance.

Although the chosen SDLC impacts the testing activities performed, we will focus on the testing best practices as established by the ISTQB rather than focusing on a single SDLC:

>1. For every software development activity, there is a corresponding test activity, so that all development activities are subject to quality control;
>2. Different test levels have specific and different test objectives, which allows for testing to be appropriately comprehensive while avoiding redundancy;
>3. Test analysis and design for a given test level begins during the corresponding development phase of the SDLC, so that testing can adhere to the principle of early testing;
>4. Testers are involved in reviewing work products as soon as drafts of this documentation are available, so that this earlier testing and defect detection can support the shift-left strategy.

This way, the documentation and instruction can be adapted and applied through the different models.

## Phases of the SDLC & Testing

### Phase 01: Planning
Understanding the needs, defining the project scope, and creating a solid execution plan.

| TESTING & QA ROLE IN PLANNING |
|-------------------------------------------|
| Providing Feedback on Requirements |

The example below is a template I created to assess the potential risks, challenges, and improvements of the login requirements and include them as comments. 

Although there are several Software Requirements Specification templates online, I couldn't find a document where Testers and the QA team could include their feedback, so I created it. It can be adapted depending on the needs of the project/tester.

### Phase 02: Design
Here, the development team translates the requirements into a technical roadmap for the software. 

| TESTING & QA ROLE IN DESIGN |
|-----------------------------------------|
| Reviewing the designs created by the development team to prevent them from writing modules that don't work or don't work as intended. |

Here's an example dataflow datagram for the ZippyBank app:

And an example of feedback provided to help make the data flow more comprehensible and avoid bottlenecks for the developers:

Feedback during the design phase is essential to prevent developers from writing modules that don't work or don't work as they are supposed to. However, finding an online template was extremely challenging, so I created the one above.

### Phase 03: Development
This is where the code is written and the software is brought to life.

| TESTING & QA ROLE IN DEVELOPMENT |
|-----------------------------------------|
| Reviewing code |
| Test plan refinement | 
| Early usability testing collaboration |

The screenshot below is a sample of a test plan built for ZippyBank. Although the test plan is much more extensive, here will see just the Features to Be Tested, Features Not to Be Tested, Testing Approach, and Pass/Fail Criteria:

### Phase 04: Testing
The built software is meticulously examined to identify bugs, ensure functionality meets requirements, and guarantee a smooth user experience. This phase is where the test plan, refined during development, comes into action.

| EXAMPLE OF ACTIVITIES IN THE TESTING PHASE |
|-----------------------------------------|
| Writing and executing the pre-defined test cases |
| Bug reporting | 
| Test results analysis & reporting |

Below is a sample-sized Test Case example for the ZippyBank's login function:

### Phase 05: Deployment
The focus is on getting the software up and running smoothly in its final environment and the QA helps ensure a successful deployment.

| EXAMPLE OF TESTING & QA ROLES IN DEPLOYMENT |
|-----------------------------------------|
| Deployment validation |
| Post-deployment testing | 
| Monitoring and supporting |

I created the following checklist to use during the deployment process to avoid pitfalls after not finding one. However, it is a general guide, and specific tasks may vary depending on the deployment approach and project needs.

### Phase 06: Maintenance
The QA's role shifts from deployment validation to ongoing monitoring and testing, ensuring the software's quality and user experience throughout its lifespan.

| EXAMPLE OF TESTING & QA ROLES IN DEPLOYMENT |
|-----------------------------------------|
| Regression testing |
| Defect management and verification | 
| Performance monitoring and optimization|

When it comes to performance monitoring and optimization, these are the KPIs I would focus on for ZippyBank's project (to start with - the list can change as the project evolves):

I created the template above to be as simple as possible so the entire team can understand what we're measuring. 

## Conclusion
Testing and QA play a vital role throughout the entire Software Development Lifecycle. Testers and QA specialists ensure the software's quality, functionality, and user experience at every stage with a well-integrated testing strategy for a successful software development process.
