## Testing Techniques
Software testing techniques are the various methods used to check that a software application functions as expected. There are many different testing techniques, and the best approach will vary depending on the specific software being tested.

## Methodology
This table covers the most common testing techniques.

| TECHNIQUE | DESCRIPTION | ADVANTAGE | DISADVANTAGE |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Unit Testing | Tests individual units of code (functions, modules) | Isolates and identifies errors early, promotes modular development | Requires good code structure, can be time-consuming for large projects |
| Integration Testing | Tests how different units interact with each other.| Ensures modules work together as expected | Can be complex for large systems, requires well-defined interfaces|
| System Testing | Tests the entire system as a whole. | Catches system-level issues, and identifies integration problems | Time-consuming, can be expensive |
| Acceptance Testing | Verifies if the system meets user requirements. | Ensures system is usable and meets business objectives | Relies on clear requirements, can be subjective based on user interpretation |
| Regression Testing | Ensures changes haven't introduced new bugs. | Protects against regressions after modifications | Can be time-consuming to maintain a large suite of tests, may not cover all edge cases |
| Performance Testing | Evaluates system performance under load. | Ensures software meets performance requirements. | Requires specialized tools and expertise, can be complex to set up |
| Equivalence Partitioning | Divides input data into valid and invalid categories for testing. | Efficient, covers a wide range of inputs. | May miss edge cases within partitions. |
| Boundary Value Analysis | Tests values at the edges of input and output boundaries. | Effective for finding errors related to data limits. | May neglect logic within boundaries. |
| Decision Table Testing | Creates a table mapping input conditions to expected outputs. | Systematic approach, good for complex decision logic. | Time-consuming to create and maintain tables.|
| State Transition Testing | Tests behavior changes between different system states. | Efficient for state-driven systems, reveals state-related bugs. | Requires a thorough understanding of system states and transitions. |
| Usability Testing | Evaluates user experience with the software. | Identifies user interface and interaction issues. | Subjective and requires representative users for testing. |
| Mutation Testing | Introduces deliberate errors (mutations) in the code and checks if tests detect them. | Improves test suite effectiveness, and identifies areas with weak test coverage. | Requires additional code and can be computationally expensive.|
| Capture-Replay Testing | Records user interactions and replays them for regression testing. | Efficient for regression testing, automates repetitive tasks. | May not capture unexpected user behavior. |

## Conclusion
The choice of testing techniques will depend on a number of factors, such as the size and complexity of the software, the project schedule, and the budget. It is important to use a combination of different testing techniques to ensure that software is thoroughly tested.
