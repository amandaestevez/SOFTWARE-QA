# Automate Tests With Automation Tools And Frameworks

This table clarifies the distinction between testing automation tools that directly interact with the application and testing automation frameworks that provide structure and support for building those tests.

## Methodology
The table will have two columns: "Feature", "Testing Automation Tools" and "Automation Testing Frameworks."  Each row will list a key characteristic and briefly describe how it applies to each category.

| FEATURE | TESTING AUTOMATION TOOLS | TESTING AUTOMATION FRAMEWORKS | 
|---------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **PURPOSE** | Provides functionalities to _automate test actions_ | Provides a structure and best practices for _building and managing test scripts_ |
| **FOCUS** | Execution and management of tests | Design and development of test scripts |
| **ABSTRACTION LEVEL** | Lower level - interacts with UI elements directly | Higher level - provides reusable components and libraries | 
| **CUSTOMIZATION** | Limited customization options | Highly customizable based on project needs |
| **EXAMPLES** | Selenium, Appium, SoapUI | Robot Framework,  TestNG,  Playwright |
| **CODING REQUIREMENTS** | May require some coding knowledge | Requires coding knowledge in a specific programming language |
| **COST**| Can be open-source or commercial | Mostly open-source |

## CONCLUSION
By differentiating between testing automation tools and frameworks, testers can select the most suitable option for crafting a reliable and sustainable test suite, ultimately optimizing their testing process.
