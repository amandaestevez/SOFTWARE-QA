# Manage Tests With Jira and Xray

This repository demonstrates a streamlined approach to software test management utilizing Jira and Xray.

_This description uses **team-managed** project._

## Methodology

**Test Case Management:**
- Leverages Xray issue types for different test case categories
- Utilizes Jira custom fields for capturing detailed test case information.
- Integrates Xray for traceability between requirements and test cases.

**Test Execution:**
- Implements Xray Test Repositories for grouping related test cases for execution.
- Employs Xray Test Runs to manage test execution cycles and record results.
- Employs Xray Test Plans to execute streamlined testing.
  
**Reporting & Analysis:**
- Utilizes Xray reporting features to visualize test coverage and execution progress.

| 1. | SETTING UP XRAY |
|--|----------------|
| 1.1. | Install the Xray app on your Jira instance. |
| 1.2. | Configure Xray by creating new issue types for test cases, pre-conditions, test sets, test plans, and test executions. |
| 1.3. | Map the new issue types to Xray entities. |
| 1.4. | Define covered issue types for defect tracking. |
| 1.5. |Set up test coverage by linking testable items to coverable ones. |

Mapping issue types:

| 2. | CREATING TEST CASES |
|--|--------------------|
| 2.1. | Create new test cases as "Test" issue types. |
| 2.2. | Choose between Manual, Cucumber (BDD), or Generic test types based on your needs. | 
| 2.3. | For Manual tests, define steps and add them sequentially. |
| 2.4. | For Cucumber tests, write test steps in the Gherkin language. |
| 2.5. | For Generic tests, provide a free-form test definition. |

| 3. | MANAGING TEST CASES | 
|--|-------|
| 3.1. | Organize test cases within a hierarchical structure using Test Repositories. |
| 3.2. | Create folders and sub-folders to categorize tests. |
| 3.3. |Drag and drop tests into folders or create new ones within the repository. |

Test Repository example:

| 4. | CREATING TEST PLANS |
|--|----------------|
| 4.1. | Define a test plan to group related test cases for execution. |
| 4.2. | Add tests to the test plan by specifying the issue ID. |
| 4.3. |Use the overview of the test plan to make edits. |

Test plans example:

| 5. | EXECUTING TESTS |
|--|------------------|
| 5.1. | Create a test execution for a specific test plan. |
| 5.2. | Initiate the test execution and record the results (pass/fail). |
| 5.3 | Check the Test Execution menu to evaluate the results. |

Test Execution example:

## Conclusion
This repository offers a configurable foundation for managing software testing within Jira and Xray, facilitating efficient test case organization, execution, and reporting.
