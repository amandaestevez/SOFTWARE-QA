**EXPLANATION**

Before diving into the answers, let's understand a few core concepts of UAT.

In this type of testing, the end users and clients will test the software in the "real world" or real-life scenarios/conditions to assess its usability and functionality.

UAT ensures the product meets real-world requirements.

There are six different types of UAT:

**- Alpha Testing:** Conducted by internal users or a limited group of external users to identify early-stage issues.
**- Beta Testing:** Involves a larger group of external users who test the product in a real-world environment.
**- Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT):** Verifies the product's ability to function in the actual production environment, including performance, security, and backup procedures.
**- Contract Acceptance Testing (CAT):** Ensures the product meets the contractual specifications and requirements agreed upon with the client.
**- Regulation Acceptance Testing (RAT):** Confirms compliance with industry regulations and standards.
**- Business Acceptance Testing (BAT):** Evaluates if the product meets the business objectives and goals.
