        # Prevent Vulnerabilities With Security Testing Techniques

This table provides a concise overview of various security testing techniques, outlining their focus and approach.

##  Methodology
The table will list common security testing techniques in one column, with a corresponding one-sentence description in the next column explaining the technique's target area and testing method.

| TYPE OF TESTING | DESCRIPTION | KEY FOCUS | METHODOLOGY | MOST USED TOOL | 
|---------|---------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Vulnerability Scanning | Automated process to identify known vulnerabilities in systems, applications, or networks | Finding weaknesses based on predefined patterns | Scans for vulnerabilities in code, configuration, or network devices | Nessus |
| Penetration Testing (Ethical Hacking) | Simulates real-world attacks to identify exploitable vulnerabilities | Uncovering critical security issues an attacker might use | Ethical hackers attempt to gain unauthorized access using various techniques | Kali Linux |
| Security Code Review | Manual examination of code to identify security flaws | Detecting vulnerabilities in code during development | Security professionals analyze code for common coding errors and security weaknesses | N/A (Manual process) |
| SAST (Static Application Security Testing) | Analyzes source code without running the application | Finding vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle | Examines code for patterns and weaknesses without executing it | Fortify on Demand |
| DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) | Tests running applications to identify vulnerabilities | Discovering vulnerabilities during runtime by simulating user interaction | Scans a running application for vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code or data | Burp Suite |
| Risk Assessment | Evaluates the likelihood and impact of potential security threats | Prioritizing security efforts based on potential risks | Analyzes threats, vulnerabilities, and potential consequences | N/A (Framework based) | 
| Security Posture Assessment | Broad evaluation of an organization's overall security posture | Identifying weaknesses across different security controls | Assesses security policies, procedures, and technical controls | SecurityScorecard |

## Conclusion
By strategically utilizing these diverse security testing techniques, organizations can proactively identify and address vulnerabilities, bolstering their overall cyber resilience.
