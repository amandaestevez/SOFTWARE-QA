   ❌ Customer support agents

_2. When should User Acceptance Testing be performed?_

   ❌ Before writing integration tests
   ❌ Before system testing
   ❌ Just after important features are implemented
   ✅ After all features have been implemented and otherwise tested

_3. How should User Acceptance Testing be performed?_

 ✅ Using real-life scenarios

**EXPLANATION**

Before diving into the answers, let's understand a few core concepts of UAT.

In this type of testing, the end users and clients will test the software in the "real world" or real-life scenarios/conditions to assess its usability and functionality.

UAT ensures the product meets real-world requirements.

There are six different types of UAT:

**- Alpha Testing:** Conducted by internal users or a limited group of external users to identify early-stage issues.
**- Beta Testing:** Involves a larger group of external users who test the product in a real-world environment.
**- Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT):** Verifies the product's ability to function in the actual production environment, including performance, security, and backup procedures.
**- Contract Acceptance Testing (CAT):** Ensures the product meets the contractual specifications and requirements agreed upon with the client.
**- Regulation Acceptance Testing (RAT):** Confirms compliance with industry regulations and standards.
**- Business Acceptance Testing (BAT):** Evaluates if the product meets the business objectives and goals.

 **ANSWERS**

 _1. Who should perform User Acceptance Testing?_

 **The customers should perform User Acceptance Testing.** These individuals should have a deep understanding of the system's requirements and how it will be used in real-world scenarios. They are the ones who will know if the software suits their needs.

_2. When should User Acceptance Testing be performed?_

**UAT should be performed after all features have been implemented and otherwise tested** to ensure the product is complete and stable for end-user evaluation.

_3. How should User Acceptance Testing be performed?_

**UAT should be conducted using real-life scenarios** to uncover issues that might not be apparent in controlled testing environments.

        # Prevent Vulnerabilities With Security Testing Techniques

This table provides a concise overview of various security testing techniques, outlining their focus and approach.

##  Methodology
The table will list common security testing techniques in one column, with a corresponding one-sentence description in the next column explaining the technique's target area and testing method.

| TYPE OF TESTING | DESCRIPTION | KEY FOCUS | METHODOLOGY | MOST USED TOOL | 
|---------|---------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Vulnerability Scanning | Automated process to identify known vulnerabilities in systems, applications, or networks | Finding weaknesses based on predefined patterns | Scans for vulnerabilities in code, configuration, or network devices | Nessus |
| Penetration Testing (Ethical Hacking) | Simulates real-world attacks to identify exploitable vulnerabilities | Uncovering critical security issues an attacker might use | Ethical hackers attempt to gain unauthorized access using various techniques | Kali Linux |
| Security Code Review | Manual examination of code to identify security flaws | Detecting vulnerabilities in code during development | Security professionals analyze code for common coding errors and security weaknesses | N/A (Manual process) |
| SAST (Static Application Security Testing) | Analyzes source code without running the application | Finding vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle | Examines code for patterns and weaknesses without executing it | Fortify on Demand |
| DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) | Tests running applications to identify vulnerabilities | Discovering vulnerabilities during runtime by simulating user interaction | Scans a running application for vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code or data | Burp Suite |
| Risk Assessment | Evaluates the likelihood and impact of potential security threats | Prioritizing security efforts based on potential risks | Analyzes threats, vulnerabilities, and potential consequences | N/A (Framework based) | 
| Security Posture Assessment | Broad evaluation of an organization's overall security posture | Identifying weaknesses across different security controls | Assesses security policies, procedures, and technical controls | SecurityScorecard |

## Conclusion
By strategically utilizing these diverse security testing techniques, organizations can proactively identify and address vulnerabilities, bolstering their overall cyber resilience.
