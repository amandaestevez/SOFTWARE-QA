# Software QA Roadmap

This GitHub repository meticulously documents the aspects of software testing, encompassing fundamental to advanced skills.

## Methodology

- Each module clearly explains the relevant software testing concepts clearly and concisely.
- Documentation may include practical templates to illustrate specific approaches, such as sample test case outlines or bug reporting formats.
- References to code snippets or external resources might be included, without directly embedding code or extensive external content.

Users will find resources on:

### Basic Testing & QA Skills

**1. [Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) & Testing:](https://github.com/AilenM93/softwareqa/tree/4a16ba48383a24a8a1b2e7a78c6c3090e3c2a3f9/00-SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT-LIFECYCLE-SDLC)** Understanding the role of testing within the entire software development lifecycle.

**2. [The Anatomy of a Test Case:](https://github.com/amandaestevez/softwareqa/tree/03531fd396603668277c9fbfa25d723c2469f1d0/01-TEST-CASES)** Crafting effective test cases that ensure errors and bugs are caught earlier in the development process.

**3. [Bug Reporting:](https://github.com/amandaestevez/softwareqa/tree/f76ecaf851d7ed7cf56cf84a268a7330aa8f9e80/02-BUG-REPORTING)** Efficiently documenting bugs with steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.

### Intermediate Testing & QA Skills:

**1. [Testing Techniques:](https://github.com/amandaestevez/softwareqa/tree/f6f74e209ec8fa73e928a1d5bcf9c5ec0ee1637c/03-TESTING-TECHNIQUES)** Exploring various testing methodologies like black-box, white-box, and exploratory testing.

**2. [Manage Tests With Jira and Xray:](https://github.com/amandaestevez/softwareqa/blob/de1f6b6a3cfe5a08bfffca3e5dc726907a7b456f/04-TEST-MANAGEMENT-TOOLS/README.md)**  Utilizing Jira for test case management.

**3. [Testing & Agile:](https://github.com/amandaestevez/softwareqa/tree/df85adf828ac8e13bd76a0deb6609d8a1741bfb5/05-TESTING-%26-AGILE)**  How testing fits in Scrum and Kanban.

**4. [Testing Per Domain](https://github.com/amandaestevez/softwareqa/tree/df2929eb6f083f9cb857be244d8e7cfadf519f70/06-TESTING-PER-DOMAIN)** Tailoring testing approaches for the top hiring industries for software development.

### Advanced Testing & QA Skills:

**1. Automation Testing:** Automating repetitive test cases with tools like Selenium and Cypress.

**2. API Testing:** testing APIs with different tools (e.g. Postman).

**3. Performance Testing:** Testing software performance under load to ensure smooth operation under real-world conditions with JMeter, LoadRunner, and Gatling.

**4. Security Testing:** Security concepts and testing software for vulnerabilities.

**5. SDLC Integration:** Advanced testers can contribute to the entire SDLC by participating in requirement reviews and design discussions, not just the testing phase.

**6. Communication & Collaboration:** Excellent communication and collaboration skills are key to working effectively with developers, project managers, and other stakeholders.

### Additionally:

**1. Analytical Thinking:** Analyzing software behavior, identifying potential issues, and critical thinking in software testing.

**2. Problem-Solving:** Troubleshooting and finding solutions to bugs and software defects.
