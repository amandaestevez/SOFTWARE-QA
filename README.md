# Software QA Roadmap

This GitHub repository meticulously documents the aspects of software testing, encompassing fundamental to advanced skills.

## Methodology

- Each module clearly explains the relevant software testing concepts clearly and concisely.
- Documentation may include practical templates to illustrate specific approaches, such as sample test case outlines or bug reporting formats.
- References to code snippets or external resources might be included, without directly embedding code or extensive external content.

Users will find resources on:

### Basic Testing & QA Skills
