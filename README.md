# Software QA Roadmap

This GitHub repository meticulously documents the aspects of software testing, encompassing fundamental to advanced skills.

## Methodology

- Each module clearly explains the relevant software testing concepts clearly and concisely.
- Documentation may include practical templates to illustrate specific approaches, such as sample test case outlines or bug reporting formats.
- References to code snippets or external resources might be included, without directly embedding code or extensive external content.

Users will find resources on:

### Basic Testing & QA Skills

**1. [Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) & Testing:](00-SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT-LIFE-CYCLE-SDLC)** Understanding the role of testing within the entire software development lifecycle.

**2. [The Anatomy of a Test Case:](https://github.com/amandaestevez/softwareqa/blob/efdf2923fb846e50d1dcf2929510f433d04bfb6d/01-TEST-CASES/011-ANATOMY-OF-TEST-CASES.md)** Crafting effective test cases that ensure errors and bugs are caught earlier in the development process.

**3. [Bug Reporting:](https://github.com/amandaestevez/softwareqa/tree/58ce499e60cd4fa89eda989b3043abb61f64cdb7/02-BUG-REPORTING)** Efficiently documenting bugs with steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.

### Intermediate Testing & QA Skills:

**1. Testing Techniques:** Exploring various testing methodologies like black-box, white-box, and exploratory testing.

**2. Test Management Tools:**  Utilizing tools like Jira, Bugzilla, TestRail, and Postman for test case management, bug tracking, and collaboration.

**3. Agile Methodology:**  Understanding Agile principles and integrating testing into frameworks like Scrum and Kanban.

**4. Domain Knowledge:** Tailoring testing approaches for specific domains like finance or healthcare.

### Advanced Testing & QA Skills:

**1. Automation Testing:** Automating repetitive test cases with tools like Selenium and Cypress.

**2. API Testing:** testing APIs with different tools (e.g. Postman).

**3. Performance Testing:** Testing software performance under load to ensure smooth operation under real-world conditions with JMeter, LoadRunner, and Gatling.

**4. Security Testing:** Security concepts and testing software for vulnerabilities.

**5. SDLC Integration:** Advanced testers can contribute to the entire SDLC by participating in requirement reviews and design discussions, not just the testing phase.

**6. Communication & Collaboration:** Excellent communication and collaboration skills are key to working effectively with developers, project managers, and other stakeholders.

### Additionally:

**1. Analytical Thinking:** Analyzing software behavior, identifying potential issues, and critical thinking in software testing.

**2. Problem-Solving:** Troubleshooting and finding solutions to bugs and software defects.


## Conclusion
This well-organized repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in exploring software testing concepts at various skill levels.  The focus remains on clear documentation, allowing users to gain insights into diverse testing practices.
