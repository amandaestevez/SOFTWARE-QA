# Software QA Roadmap

This GitHub repository meticulously documents the aspects of software testing, encompassing fundamental to advanced skills.

## Methodology

- Each module clearly explains the relevant software testing concepts clearly and concisely.
- Documentation may include practical templates to illustrate specific approaches, such as sample test case outlines or bug reporting formats.
- References to code snippets or external resources might be included, without directly embedding code or extensive external content.

Users will find resources on:

### Basic Testing & QA Skills

**1. [Implementing Testing Through the Software Development Lifecyle](https://github.com/amandaestevez/softwareqa/tree/9bff7ca9b096b920a63c2dcd3ad8945d8a082b2e/00-IMPLEMENTING-TESTING-THROUGH-SDLC)** Understanding the role of testing within the entire software development lifecycle.
