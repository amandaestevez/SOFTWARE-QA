### Previously
In the previous chapter([click here to read it](https://github.com/amandaestevez/softwareqa/blob/3881ac15dfa8e1b06ae15f38b52bbf23335505bf/00-SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT-LIFECYCLE-SDLC/001-SLDC-TESTING-%26-QA.md)), you saw the main activities that *ZippyBank's* testing team worked on throughout the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Now you will go through their test case.

## Abstract
This document outlines a well-defined, standardized test case structure based on the industry's established best practices, detailing the core components of a test case.

## What's a Test Case?
A test case is a set of instructions that checks if *software works as planned*, with specific steps, inputs, and expected results.

The image above shows the test case structure we will detail in the following paragraphs.

## Why Are Test Cases Important?
By planning tests, ***we can identify issues early on, saving time and money compared to fixing bugs after release***. 

## Methodology:

This document outlines a standardized structure for test case development through the case study of ZippyBank's mobile app development.

Although the design may vary between companies, these core components remain crucial in ensuring the tests are performed correctly.

## Standardized Test Case Structure for Enhanced Software Quality

It is a good practice that test cases follow the structure below, creating a well-defined format that facilitates efficient test creation, execution, and management:

* **Test Case ID:**  A unique identifier assigned to each test case for easy reference and traceability within the testing process.

 It simplifies test organization.

* **Test Case Description:**  A clear and concise description of the functionality or scenario being tested.

This description should be crafted for comprehension by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

* **Dependencies:** External factors that rely on _the successful execution of other test cases_ before the current test case can be run.

* **Pre-Conditions:**  Specific conditions _within the testing environment_ that must be met before running a test case. This may include system configurations, specific data setup requirements, or user permissions necessary for test execution.

Documenting pre-conditions eliminates ambiguity and ensures a consistent testing environment for all test cases. 

* **Test Data:** Specific input values used to execute and verify the expected results of a test case.

* **Test Scenario:** Sets the stage for the test case by describing the broader functionality or user story being tested.

This minimizes the risk of testers focusing on irrelevant details or missing the core objective.

* **Test Steps:**  A numbered sequence outlining the actions the tester should perform to execute the test. Each step should be clear, concise, and actionable, ensuring unambiguous execution.

Numbered steps promote a structured testing approach, minimizing the risk of missed steps or errors during test execution.

* **Expected Results:**  This section describes the anticipated outcome for each test step, _focusing on the system's behavior under normal conditions._

* **Actual Results:** The tester's observations during test execution, compared against expected results.

The Actual Results determine pass/fail and identify potential defects.

* **Pass/Fail Criteria:**  This section defines the specific conditions that determine whether the test case has passed or failed. _It goes beyond just describing the expected outcome and sets a clear benchmark for evaluating the actual results._

* **Pass/Fail/Not Executed/Suspended:** The current state of the test case.

![image](https://github.com/amandaestevez/softwareqa/assets/123298275/bfe1ffe3-ff00-4d2b-8e07-3c05382ccf21)

Here, testers define whether the test passed or failed according to the expected results and the Pass/Fail criteria.

* **Post-Conditions:**  Any actions required after completing the test case, such as data cleanup or system reset. 

![image](https://github.com/amandaestevez/softwareqa/assets/123298275/c90942d0-a8a1-47d2-8610-eaf2d76ec52b)

Specifying post-conditions ensures the testing environment is maintained clean for subsequent test case execution. 

* **Additional Information (Optional):**  This section can include relevant details such as:

    * **Severity:**  Classification of the defect identified through the test case (High, Medium, Low). Severity helps prioritize bug fixes based on potential impact. It can be included as a separate section in the test case. However, the best practice is to report it in a separate defect tracking system.

    * **Priority:**  Prioritization of the test case for execution (High, Medium, Low). Prioritization guides testing efforts, ensuring critical functionalities are tested first.

    * **Traceability:**  Links to specific requirements documents for comprehensive traceability.

      Traceability ensures that all project requirements are thoroughly tested, minimizing the risk of defects slipping into production.

## Conclusion

AA standardized test case structure fosters clear communication, enhances testing efficiency, minimizes errors, and streamlines traceability throughout the development lifecycle.
